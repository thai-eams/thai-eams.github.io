<h2>TEAMS President</h2>

<p>On behalf of my beloved TEAMS members, welcome to TagTEAMS 2026.</p>

<p>What began as a bold idea has become a living, resonant reality. Presented by the Thai ElectroAcoustic Music Society (TEAMS), this inaugural edition transforms the heart of Bangkok’s Chinatown into a landscape of sound, where narrow streets vibrate with new frequencies and familiar spaces are reimagined through listening.</p>

<p>TagTEAMS 2026 is a meeting of worlds, bringing together immersive artworks, radical sonic experiments, technological spectacles, and quiet moments of deep attention. With over 60 artists from across the globe, this festival is not merely a program of performances. It is an invitation to experience sound as architecture, as memory, and as future.</p>

<a>Here, cultures intersect through loudspeakers and reflect in space. </a>
<br>
<a>Here, ideas echo beyond language.</a>
<br>
<a>Here, a new community gathers, curious, daring, and ready to listen differently.</a>

<p>Thank you for joining us at the beginning of what we hope will be an enduring resonance.</p>

<p>Enjoy the journey, and welcome to the TEAMS!</p>
<a>– Sippapas Thienwiwat<br>
TEAMS President</a>
