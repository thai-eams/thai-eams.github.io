<h2>About TagTEAMS 2026</h2>

<p>TagTEAMS 2026 is a coming together of cultures across the globe, a gathering of immersive artworks and impressive ideas, a showcase of technological spectacles of the contemporary world, and a gathering of a new community. All of this—for the first time—set in the heart of Bangkok’s ever-lasting Chinatown. The Thai ElectroAcoustic Music Society (TEAMS) proudly presents the premiere edition of an annual festival in Thailand: the first of its kind to focus on the presentation of acousmatic music, multimedia art, and live electroacoustic performances. TagTEAMS 2026 will feature works by over 60 artists, including works curated from an international call for works, commissions, and a pool of emerging and esteemed artists.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century, electroacoustic music has more than ever become a global art form. It is capable of carrying the diversity of local knowledge and culture, all while simultaneously uniting everyone through a collective curiosity and a drive for innovation. The inaugural edition of TagTEAMS is initiated in this spirit: to bring together and celebrate this community and its people, from artists to audience, who make this endeavour forever worthwhile.</p>
