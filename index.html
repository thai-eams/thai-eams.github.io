<h1>Thai ElectroAcoustic Music Society (TEAMS)</h1>

<h2>About TEAMS</h2>

<p>Thai ElectroAcoustic Music Society (TEAMS) is a non-profit organization run by Thai music students studying in Thailand and abroad, focusing on the promotion of virtually all kinds of work associated with electroacoustic music and digital arts in Thailand, with an emphasis on youth artists. Free from institutional constraints and school-specific practices, TEAMS is a platform that fosters interactions between artists across various disciplines to engage in sound-making and artistic expression.</p>

<p>TEAMS is also home to TEAMSmulch, a modular sound diffusion system designed for the performance of various forms of electronic media, with a focus on electroacoustic music, both fixed media (sur support) and live electronics. Originally developed for the evals live-coding performance at Bangkok Kunsthalle, TEAMSmulch made its official 8.2 debut as part of the Triphens Ensemble concerts at the Thailand International Composition Festival (TICF) 2025, held at the College of Music, Mahidol University.</p>
